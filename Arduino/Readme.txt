The original Arduino firmware has been depreciated for some time and has now been removed.

It is recommended that all builds should use the ESP32 Version 4.

If an Arduino version is preferred, then please see the Arduino V2 folder.

Some old version 1 documents, excluding firmware are left here for reference.
