The latest build guides and firmware for Version 4 of the Shutter Tester are listed here.

The build guides have been updated to Version 4, showing the use of JST HX connectors, rather than Dupont wires.

The only hardware change from V3 to V4 is the addition of a rotary encoder 
and the use of JST HX connectors and wiring colours in place of Dupont.
(Which does not effect functionality).

With the addition of a rotary encoder, V3 hardware will work with V4 firmware,
without any other changes.

Note V4 firmware requires the use of a one-time passkey.
This is issued free of charge upon request.
