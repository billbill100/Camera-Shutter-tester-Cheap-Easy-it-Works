In the folder ShutterTesterCase3dPrinted, You will find - 

TheShutterTesterBox - The main part of the box with front and sides.
TheShutterTesterBottom - which is the bottom of the box

There are three additional files for the rear, you only need to print one of these -

TheShutterTesterRear             - which is plain and the easiest to print.
TheShutterTesterRearEngravedText - which has text legends recessed into the case and prints in one colour
TheShutterTesterRearFlushText    - which has text in a diffferent colour printed on the rear. 

The third file (above) is for experienced 3d printers only. 
The text height is set to 0.2mm, so text will print as one layer minimising wasted purge filiment.
You will have to split the file and select the two bodies (text & main part) to select the different print colours.


TheShutterTesterBlank            - which is a blanking plate for unused socket holes on the rear of the case. It requires gluing in.

Supports are not needed for the prints. It is designed to assemble using 2mm screws in the holes.
Ensure the screw fits ok, drill out if the hole is too tight, to avoid splittingthe print.
All printed with PLA, 4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layers.

If you print any of these, please give feedback as to if they are ok, or any errors that need correcting
