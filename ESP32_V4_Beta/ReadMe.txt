The latest firmware, V4, is listed here in Beta form
to allow testers & early adopters to access to the code.

The V3 build guides will be updated, showing the use of the new JST connectors, 
but for now, the V3 build guides can be used.

The hardware changes from V3 to V4 are the addition of a rotary encoder 
and the use of JST HX connectors and wiring colours in place of Dupont.
(Which does not effect functionality).

V3 firmware will work on V4 hardware.

With the addition of a rotary encoder, V3 hardware will work with V4 firmware.

Note V4 firmware requires the use of a one-time passkey.
This is issued free of charge upon request.
